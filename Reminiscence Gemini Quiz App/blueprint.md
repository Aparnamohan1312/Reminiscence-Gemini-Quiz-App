# **App Name**: Memory Lane Quiz

## Core Features:

- Quiz Interface: Design an intuitive quiz interface using Material UI components to make the quiz user-friendly. Use GraphQL
- Local Data Storage: Store question and answer data locally as JSON. Create a lookup table to map quiz results to specific photo URLs. The result page will simply render the URL returned. Use Firebase
- AI-Powered Photo Captions: Integrate a generative AI tool to provide personalized captions or descriptions for the displayed memory photo, based on the quiz answers. The AI will use a tool to decide if a caption is needed.
- Quiz progress: Include clear progress indication through the quiz.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a calming primary color like light blue (#E3F2FD) to create a relaxed atmosphere.
- Choose a secondary color such as pale green (#DCEDC8) to complement the primary color and evoke a sense of nostalgia.
- Accent: Use a soft coral (#FFAB91) for buttons and interactive elements, making them visually distinct.
- Employ a clean, single-column layout to focus the user's attention on the quiz questions and resulting memory.
- Utilize simple, line-based icons for navigation and feedback to maintain a modern and uncluttered look.
- Incorporate subtle transition animations between questions and when revealing the memory photo to enhance user experience.
